INSTALLATION:

put where it suits you

please respect this hierarchy:

a folder
    |
    |-smplayer-web.py
    |-home.html
    |-images
        |-well... the images.

CONFIGURATION:
well for the moment it opens the 8080 port. if you want to modify it you can look at the source the "port = 8080" line and edit it accordingly.

USAGE:

run with
$ python smplayer-web.py

connect with the browser to 
http://yourcomputer:8080
and have a running istance of smplayer with the "one-istance" feature on.

NOTES:
you will need to click (or tap) to every button every time you want to do something.
That means increase_volume and decrease_volume will NOT work keeping pressed. You need to click/tap every time.

I warn you that this program is not meant to be used on a public host.

CREDITS:
